# Known Limitations

Append-only log of behaviors discovered during the build that aren't
contract violations or stop-gate failures, but are worth carrying forward
deliberately rather than losing to memory. Referenced by the Build Guide's

## [B5] Silent suppression of restated obligations

- **Discovered:** B5, during the mandatory-recall stop-gate investigation.
  A batch-size experiment (`MAX_EXTRACTION_BATCH_TOKENS` 1200 → 400) plus
  manual chunk/batch/template analysis of the false negatives.
- **Behaviour:** the extraction LLM (Gemini) appears to drop one of two
  near-identical restatements of the same obligation when both are visible
  to it, with no confidence signal, no dedup log entry, and no
  `agent_traces` note distinguishing "not present in source" from "present
  but suppressed as a duplicate." Two discriminators from the B5
  investigation rule out batch density as the cause: REQ-066 was missed
  even alone in a 3-item batch, and a template-identical pair (REQ-031 /
  REQ-058) was split across two separate LLM calls with zero co-location
  and both were still missed.
- **Risk:** harmless in the case actually observed — the ground-truth
  generator had mislabeled two identical-substance restatements (same
  subject/object, differing only in modal verb) as two distinct planted
  items, and fixing the generator (see `scripts/synthetic_tender_a.py`)
  resolved the recall gap. But real tenders restate obligations across the
  RFP body, annexures, and compliance checklists with materially
  different deadlines, scopes, or amounts. If the same suppression
  applies to genuinely divergent restatements, the stricter or
  authoritative version could be silently dropped with no indication
  anything was discarded — feeding B6 (compliance mapping) and B7
  (evidence linking) a decision built on the wrong requirement text.
- **Status:** verified for this specific seeded case, on this model, as of
  B7 (see "Scheduled verification" below) — 3/3 live Gemini extraction
  runs kept both REQ-073 and REQ-074 distinct with exact durations intact.
  This is a narrow result, not a general guarantee: see the scoping note
  below before reading it as "the suppression risk is closed."
- **Test:** REQ-073 (RFP body: audit logs retained a minimum of one year)
  / REQ-074 (annexure: audit logs retained a minimum of three years) are
  planted as a deliberate divergent-restatement pair — same obligation,
  materially different duration. See `tender_a_requirements.jsonl` and the
  `requirement_divergence` record in `tender_a_knowledge.jsonl`. B5's own
  eval doesn't assert anything special about this pair (plain token-match
  recall/precision only, same as every other requirement). A future block
  should check whether both are extracted and, ideally, whether the
  divergence itself is surfaced to a reviewer rather than one silently
  winning.
- **Scheduled verification — result (B7), code-path check:**
  `tests/integration/test_compliance_analysis_node.py::
  test_req073_074_divergent_restatements_get_independent_compliance_entries`
  runs both REQ-073/REQ-074 through the real `requirement_extraction_node`
  (not a synthetic direct-insert) and then the real `compliance_analysis_node`,
  against `FakeLLMClient` (scripted, deterministic responses), same as every
  other automated test in this repo. Two things confirmed, in order: (1)
  **precondition** — both requirements survive real extraction with their
  distinct durations ("one year" / "three years") intact, checked as its own
  assertion so this test fails loudly on that line, not silently, if
  extraction ever collapses them; (2) given the precondition holds, the
  compliance layer produces two distinct `compliance_entries` rows, and
  neither's `reasoning_summary` references the other's duration — no
  cross-contamination in the compliance layer itself. This confirms the
  *code path* is safe when both survive extraction; it says nothing about
  whether a *live* model actually lets both survive.

- **Scheduled verification — result (B7), live-model check:**
  `scripts/verify_req073_074_divergence.py` (one-off, not part of the
  pytest suite — deliberately excluded from the "every test runs against
  FakeLLMClient" rule, since its entire purpose is to exercise a real
  model) runs real `extract_requirements` against real Gemini
  (`EXTRACTOR_MODEL`), against fresh tenders built from the actual
  `rfp.pdf`/`technical_annexure.docx` fixture documents (the same two
  files REQ-073/REQ-074 are planted in), **3 times**, not once — recall is
  already known to be nondeterministic at temperature=0 (0.941-0.959
  across B5's own runs), so a single pass cannot distinguish "this case is
  safe" from "this run got lucky." Two infrastructure issues had to be
  ruled out first, both live-Docker-stack artifacts unrelated to the
  question being tested: (a) `GeminiClient`'s response cache is keyed
  purely on prompt content with no tender/run scoping
  (`agents/llm/gemini_adapter.py::_cache_key`), so all 3 runs would have
  silently replayed the first run's cached response instead of making
  independent live calls — worked around by giving each run its own Redis
  DB, not a fix to the cache itself (see the standalone entry below); (b)
  running the script while the real `worker`/`outbox_dispatcher`
  containers were also live caused both to independently process the same
  uploaded document via the async outbox path *at the same time* as the
  script's own direct `parse_and_embed_document` call, producing a
  `ForeignKeyViolationError` on `requirements.source_chunk_id` (a
  concurrent-reprocessing race, the same shape B6's own stale-RQ-backlog
  investigation found once already) — worked around by stopping those two
  containers before running the script, not a fix to the race itself.

  **Result: 3/3 runs kept both REQ-073 and REQ-074 present, each with its
  planted duration intact, byte-for-byte** ("Audit logs shall be retained
  for a minimum of one year." / "...three years.", 79 total requirements
  extracted each run). Full output preserved in this session's transcript.

  **Scope of what this does and doesn't establish:** this is a real,
  live-model result — not a simulation — for exactly the case seeded:
  two sentences, same template, differing only in one duration phrase,
  each alone in its own document. It is **not** a general guarantee that
  Gemini extraction never suppresses divergent restatements. Real tenders
  restate obligations far messier than this — different phrasing entirely,
  restated across three or more places, buried in dense paragraphs rather
  than isolated sentences, or divergent in ways subtler than a single
  number. B5's original filler-pair suppression (near-identical text) is
  still a confirmed, real phenomenon; this result only shows that the
  *specific* divergent-restatement shape B7 was asked to check does not
  currently trigger it. If a genuinely different divergence shape shows
  suppression in the future, that would be a new, separate finding, not a
  contradiction of this one.

## [B7] LLM response cache has no tender/run scoping

- **Discovered:** while running `scripts/verify_req073_074_divergence.py`
  (see the entry above) — 3 "independent" runs against byte-identical
  source documents would have silently collapsed into 1 real call plus 2
  cache replays, defeating the entire point of running 3 times.
- **Behaviour:** `agents/llm/gemini_adapter.py::_cache_key` hashes only
  `(model, schema_name, system_prompt, user_prompt)`. Two calls with
  identical prompt content hit the same Redis key regardless of which
  tender, organization, or run they came from. By the time this was found,
  186 cached responses already existed in this session's Redis instance
  from ordinary B5/B6/B7 live testing.
- **Risk:** low for the product itself — within one real tender, prompt
  content is naturally unique (real chunk text differs per document), so
  production traffic is unlikely to collide. The real risk is entirely on
  the *evaluation/verification* side: any future live-model script that
  re-runs the same fixture documents multiple times to check
  determinism (exactly what this entry's own verification script needed
  to do) will silently get cached replays instead of independent calls
  unless it explicitly works around this, the way
  `verify_req073_074_divergence.py` now does (a fresh Redis DB per run).
  A script that didn't know to work around this would report false
  "consistency" - N identical results from what looks like N live calls
  but is actually 1 live call plus N-1 cache hits.
- **Status:** unverified / accepted as a known gap, not fixed. The correct
  fix (if this becomes load-bearing beyond one-off verification scripts) is
  scoping the cache key to include a caller-supplied identifier - not
  attempted here since the workaround (isolated Redis DB per run) fully
  solved the immediate need without touching shared adapter code B5/B6/B7
  all already depend on working as-is.
- **Test:** none dedicated. `verify_req073_074_divergence.py`'s own
  per-run Redis DB isolation is the direct evidence this gap is real and
  exploitable, not a test asserting the cache's own key-collision
  behavior.
- **See also:** "Standing pattern: measurement/verification tooling is a
  recurring source of false signals" below — this is instance 3 of that
  pattern, and the one that would have produced the cleanest-looking false
  result of the three (a perfect 3/3 from what was actually one trial).

## [B5] REQ-018 missed in every run

- **Discovered:** B5. Present as a false negative in all three eval runs
  this block — the original run (batch=1200), the batch-size experiment
  (batch=400), and the fixed-generator re-run (batch=1200) — the only
  requirement to miss under every configuration tried.
- **Behaviour:** `[REQ-018] Additional case studies beyond the required
  minimum are welcome but will not affect the technical score.` is never
  extracted, regardless of batching or the generator fix.
- **Risk:** low for now — REQ-018 is optional, not mandatory, so it has
  never affected the stop-gate (0.959 mandatory recall, well above the
  0.90 floor). Its consistency across every configuration change is more
  likely a stable, sentence- or position-specific cause (it sits
  immediately after REQ-017 in the same source chunk) than run-to-run
  noise, but this hasn't been root-caused.
- **Status:** unverified / accepted. The gate passes with margin and the
  explicit call this block was not to chase the remaining misses further.
- **Test:** none dedicated — it's a standing item in the existing ground
  truth (`technical_annexure.docx`, optional, category `other`).

## [B5] Extraction is not fully deterministic at temperature=0

- **Discovered:** B5, comparing two back-to-back eval runs on the same
  fixed generator and the same `MAX_EXTRACTION_BATCH_TOKENS=1200`, the
  only difference being the second run added the REQ-073/074
  divergent-restatement pair (49 -> 51 mandatory ground-truth items).
- **Behaviour:** mandatory recall moved 0.959 (47/49) -> 0.941 (48/51)
  between the two runs, and the specific miss membership changed, not
  just the count: REQ-046 missed in run 1, correctly extracted in run 2;
  REQ-037 and REQ-038 correctly extracted in run 1, missed in run 2.
  REQ-039 missed in both. Both runs used temperature=0. This isn't a
  cache-hit artifact — batch composition changed between runs (new items
  added), so both were fresh, uncached LLM calls, not a replay of stored
  output.
- **Risk:** temperature=0 is often assumed to guarantee identical output
  for identical input; that assumption doesn't hold here, at least not at
  the batch level. Mandatory recall has landed in a 0.941-0.959 band
  across this block's fixed-generator runs, comfortably above the 0.90
  floor each time, but any single run that happened to land close to the
  boundary — passing or failing — should not be read as decisive on its
  own. A future block re-running this eval near the boundary could see
  either outcome without any code change.
- **Status:** unverified / accepted. Observed, not root-caused (plausibly
  provider-side non-determinism in Gemini's sampling, which is documented
  as a real phenomenon for some providers even at temperature=0). Not
  something this block will chase further.
- **Test:** none dedicated. The two fixed-generator runs in this block's
  history are the only evidence so far. A future block could add a
  repeated-run variance check if determinism becomes load-bearing
  somewhere (e.g. a CI gate that must be stable, not just passing once).

## [B6] Employee dedup matches on normalized name, not fuzzy similarity

- **Discovered:** B6, live test of `import_employee_master_row` against the
  seeded `EMP-01`/`EMP-05` duplicate fixture (`Dana Whitfield` /
  `Dana Whitfield (dup)`). The parenthetical suffix meant the two names
  weren't byte-identical, which surfaced the gap.
- **Behaviour:** `agents/knowledge/dedup.py`'s `normalize_employee_name`
  strips parenthetical content, accents, casing, and extra whitespace, then
  compares for exact equality. This correctly catches parenthetical/
  whitespace/case/accent variants of the same name (confirmed: `Dana
  Whitfield (dup)` now matches `Dana Whitfield` and routes to
  `needs_review`, pointing at the correct existing employee). It does
  **not** catch nicknames (`Dan` vs `Daniel`), typos, or transpositions —
  those require similarity scoring, not exact matching on a normalized
  form, and no such scoring is implemented.
- **Risk:** low and deliberate, not an oversight. Build Guide line 3069
  requires duplicate detection "using employee code, email, normalized
  name, and resume hash" — normalized-name matching is exactly what's
  implemented. Fuzzy/similarity matching (nicknames, typos) is not on the
  B6 build list and was never in scope; adding it later would mean a
  similarity threshold and likely the Postgres `pg_trgm` extension, both
  real design decisions, not a bug fix.
- **Deliberate non-normalization, worth preserving:** suffix/title tokens
  (`Jr`, `Sr`, `III`, `Dr`, `Mr`, `Mrs`, ...) are intentionally **not**
  stripped. `John Smith Jr.` and `John Smith Sr.` are frequently two real,
  different people at the same company (often related) — collapsing that
  distinction would silently merge two employees, which is a worse failure
  than missing a duplicate. If this is ever "improved" to strip suffixes
  for better recall, that trade-off needs to be made consciously, not
  rediscovered as a regression.
- **Status:** accepted — a deliberate scope boundary, not an open question.
- **Test:** `EMP-01`/`EMP-05` in the synthetic fixture is the standing case
  for what normalized-name matching *does* catch. No fixture exists yet for
  a nickname/typo near-duplicate, since that's explicitly out of scope.

## Standing pattern: measurement/verification tooling is a recurring source of false signals

- **Discovered:** first observed B5, confirmed as a genuine pattern (not a
  one-off) B6, confirmed a third time B7. Three independent instances now:
  1. **B5** — the ground-truth generator itself had a page/template-index
     coupling bug that mislabeled two identical-substance restatements as
     distinct planted items, producing an apparent recall gap that was
     actually a generator bug, not an extraction defect.
  2. **B6** — `evals/retrieval.py::evaluate_retrieval`'s ground-truth
     lookup had no `tender_id` filter, so it could silently score a stale
     row from a *different* eval run's tender instead of the current run's
     own extraction (see the entry immediately below for full detail —
     kept as its own entry since it's the specific bug/fix, this entry is
     the pattern the three instances together establish).
  3. **B7** — `scripts/verify_req073_074_divergence.py`, built specifically
     to check whether live Gemini extraction ever drops one of two
     divergent restatements, would have reported a clean "3/3 consistent"
     result from `GeminiClient`'s response cache (keyed on prompt content
     alone, no tender/run scoping — see the `[B7] LLM response cache has
     no tender/run scoping` entry) silently replaying run 1's single real
     call as runs 2 and 3. Caught only because the cache-hit path was
     inspected before trusting the number, not because anything failed
     loudly.
- **The heuristic this establishes:** when a verification number comes back
  looking suspiciously clean — no misses, no variance, "3/3 consistent,"
  a suspiciously round or expected figure — suspect the measurement
  tooling before concluding the pipeline is actually that good. A broken
  pipeline tends to fail loudly or obviously (wrong shape, exception,
  visibly wrong output). Broken *measurement* code reports a confident,
  plausible, clean number instead — which is a worse failure mode
  precisely because a clean result is the one result nobody double-checks.
  All three instances above share this exact shape: the tooling was wrong
  in a way that made the pipeline look *better* than it actually was (B5:
  hid a real gap behind a mislabeled ground-truth item; B6: could have
  hidden a real regression behind a stale cross-run score; B7: would have
  hidden the fact that only one real trial ever ran behind an apparent
  3-for-3).
- **Status:** accepted as a standing risk, not something any one fix
  closes out — this is a statement about how measurement code fails, not a
  single bug with a single patch. Concretely: any future block writing a
  new eval script, verification script, or repeated-trial check should
  budget time to inspect the tooling's own correctness (does it scope
  queries correctly, does it bypass caches when independence matters, does
  the ground-truth data actually assert what it claims to) with the same
  seriousness given to the pipeline it's measuring, *especially* when the
  first result looks good.
- **Test:** none dedicated to the pattern itself (it's a process note, not
  a code path). Each instance's own fix/workaround is tested or documented
  at its own entry.

## [B6] Eval/measurement code needs the same scrutiny as pipeline code

- **Discovered:** B6, `evals/retrieval.py`'s first real gate run. A fresh,
  correctly-built retrieval pipeline reported Recall@10 = 0.600 (FAIL) on a
  properly-scoped re-run, which looked like a pipeline defect at first —
  the actual cause turned out to be `RETRIEVAL_TOP_K` in `.env` (10, not
  the 20 the B6 plan proposed and had not yet been confirmed against a
  real run). Along the way, a second, independent bug surfaced in the same
  function: `evaluate_retrieval`'s lookup of a ground-truth requirement's
  text used `select(Requirement).where(...).limit(1)` with **no
  `tender_id` filter** — since the `requirements` table accumulates rows
  across every past eval run in this database (each `scripts/run_eval.py`/
  `run_retrieval_eval.py` invocation creates a fresh tender), this could
  silently pull a stale row from a *different* run's tender instead of the
  current run's own extraction. Fixed by requiring `tender_id` as a
  parameter and scoping the query to it.
- **Behaviour:** the data-leakage bug did not change the reported number in
  this instance (the affected requirement's text is a hand-authored,
  verbatim-preserved sentence, so it was byte-identical across every past
  run) — but it was a real defect that could silently score a different
  run's data under the current run's report, especially for anything where
  extraction *isn't* perfectly verbatim across runs (see the temperature=0
  non-determinism entry above, which shows extraction output does vary
  run-to-run for at least some items).
- **Risk:** this is the **second** time in this build that a wrong-looking
  number traced back to measurement code, not the pipeline it was
  measuring — B5's ground-truth generator confound (page/template index
  coupling) was the first. A broken pipeline tends to fail loudly or
  obviously; broken *measurement* code reports a confident, plausible,
  wrong number instead, which is a worse failure mode because nothing
  prompts a second look. Eval/harness code should get the same "verify by
  running it, don't just review it" treatment as pipeline code — it isn't
  exempt just because it's test infrastructure rather than product code.
- **Status:** resolved for the specific bug found (tender_id scoping now
  required, not optional, in `evaluate_retrieval`'s signature). The general
  pattern (measurement code as a distinct source of false signals) is
  recorded here as an accepted standing risk, not something one fix closes
  out.
- **Test:** none dedicated yet for the scoping bug specifically — the fix
  is a required parameter (a caller *must* pass `tender_id`, so the
  unscoped-query shape can't silently return), which closes the specific
  hole structurally rather than via a regression test. A future block
  could add an explicit test asserting `evaluate_retrieval` only ever
  reads `Requirement` rows for the given `tender_id` if this becomes
  load-bearing enough to warrant one.

## [B6] DEMONSTRATES never auto-verifies under its own corroboration signal

- **Discovered:** B6, live test of `extract_demonstrates` +
  `resolve_demonstrates_verification` against all 4 real past-project
  records in the synthetic fixture. Every LLM-proposed edge came back
  `needs_review`, including ones at LLM confidence 1.00.
- **Behaviour:** `resolve_demonstrates_verification` reuses
  `WORKED_ON`'s exact decision matrix (`VERIFIED` requires both a
  confident LLM *and* a corroborating deterministic signal), but its
  corroboration check — do the capability's own meaningful words appear
  in the project's description text — never fires in practice. Confirmed
  directly: "Citizen Services Portal"'s description ("Built and operated
  a public-facing citizen services portal...") shares zero tokens with
  "Public-Sector Delivery," even though the LLM's link is a reasonable
  one.
- **Why this is structural, not a mis-set threshold:** `WORKED_ON`'s
  corroboration works because "did this person work on this project"
  leaves a lexical trace — the same project gets named, however loosely,
  in both the resume and the canonical record. `DEMONSTRATES` asks
  whether a project demonstrates a *capability*, and a capability is an
  abstraction over the description, not a paraphrase of it — "migrated
  40TB from Oracle to PostgreSQL" demonstrates "database migration" with
  zero token overlap by construction, because the whole point of the
  capability label is to name a category the concrete text never states
  directly. No overlap threshold, loose or strict, changes this: loosening
  it would make the signal fire on word coincidences unrelated to whether
  the inference was correct, producing edges that auto-verify for reasons
  disconnected from their truth — the same failure shape as B5's
  character-count-as-token-count proxy (a cheap heuristic standing in for
  the real property, with an invisible failure mode). An honest "cannot
  corroborate this" is more useful than a signal that looks like
  corroboration but isn't.
- **Practical cost:** every `DEMONSTRATES` edge this policy proposes
  currently routes to human review, regardless of LLM confidence — there
  is no auto-verify path for this relationship type as built. If real
  usage volume makes 100% manual review of project×capability pairs
  unworkable, the identified fix is a *better* signal, not a looser one:
  embedding cosine similarity between the capability's name/description
  and the project's description would actually capture the semantic
  relationship token overlap structurally cannot. Not implemented — noted
  as the known path forward, not a task in progress.
- **Status:** accepted — a deliberate conservative default (100% review
  for an inherently abstractive relationship is defensible, not an
  oversight), not unverified.
- **Test:** the 4 real project/capability pairs from this session's live
  run are the standing evidence for the current behaviour. No fixture
  exists yet asserting the embedding-similarity alternative, since it
  isn't built.

## [B6] knowledge_import_batches.status never advances past 'queued'

- **Discovered:** B6's own Docker smoke test, run end to end against the
  live API/worker/outbox_dispatcher stack. Every upload's batch showed
  `status: "queued"` via `GET /knowledge/import-batches/{id}` even after
  `process_knowledge_document_import` had fully completed and every item
  in the batch showed `approved`/`needs_review`.
- **Behaviour:** the worker job (`apps/worker/jobs/knowledge_import.py`)
  updates individual `knowledge_import_items` rows as it processes each
  row/extraction, but never writes back to the parent
  `knowledge_import_batches.status` field itself - there is no code path
  that ever sets it to anything but its `'queued'` default.
- **Risk:** low, and not a correctness problem - a reviewer polling
  `GET .../import-batches/{id}/items` (which this session's smoke test
  and the actual review flow both use) sees accurate, real-time item
  status regardless. The batch-level status field is simply dead/
  unreliable if anything ever reads it expecting a `completed` value -
  a future UI built against the batch summary endpoint rather than the
  items list would show a permanently-misleading "queued" badge.
- **Status:** unverified / accepted. Not fixed this block - noted rather
  than patched under time pressure at the end of B6, since the fix
  (update batch.status + total_items/completed_items/failed_items as
  process_knowledge_document_import runs) is mechanical but touches a
  file already carrying a lot of new logic this block.
- **Test:** none dedicated. Observed directly via the live smoke test's
  batch responses; no automated assertion exists for batch.status
  specifically.

## [B7] Compliance gate rejection kills the whole run, including unrelated completed branches

- **Discovered:** B7 planning (flagged before implementation, not found via
  testing) — reviewing how `compliance_gate_node` should fit into
  `orchestration/graph.py`'s existing fan-out (`specialist_dispatch` sends
  `compliance_analysis`, `talent_stub`, `commercial_stub` in parallel,
  joining at `specialist_join`).
- **Topology note (found during implementation, not part of this
  limitation itself):** the plan's original design nested
  `compliance_gate_node` *inside* `compliance_analysis`'s own Send()'d
  branch, between it and `specialist_join`. That was a real bug, not just
  a design question — an `interrupt()`-bearing node upstream of a Send()
  fan-in join replays its entire function (including re-delivering a
  fresh trigger into the join) every time a *later*, unrelated interrupt
  elsewhere in the same continuation gets resumed, which left the whole
  workflow permanently stuck after approving `final_readiness` (caught via
  a live step-by-step debug run, not by an assertion alone). Fixed by
  moving `compliance_gate_node` to *after* `specialist_join`, the same
  safe sequential slot `final_gate_node` already occupies. This entry's
  own subject — reject-path behavior — is unaffected by that fix and is
  written against the corrected topology below.
- **Behaviour:** `compliance_gate_node` mirrors `requirement_gate_node`'s
  only precedent in this codebase for a rejected gate: on `decision ==
  "reject"`, it marks the whole `workflow_run` `"rejected"` (coarse status
  `"failed"`) and returns, same as `requirement_gate_node` does. For
  `requirement_gate_node` this is correct — it gates entry into the
  specialist branches, so nothing has run yet. For `compliance_gate_node`,
  now positioned *after* `specialist_join`, it's a weaker fit for a
  different reason than originally described: by the time this gate can
  reject, `talent_stub`/`commercial_stub` have *already run to
  completion* (their `WorkflowTask` rows already show `completed`) — a
  rejection here doesn't stop them from running, it aborts the whole run
  after the fact, so whatever they produced is real, persisted, completed
  work that the run then never proceeds to use.
- **Risk:** currently low — `talent_stub`/`commercial_stub` are still B3
  stubs that do nothing but mark their own task complete, so there is
  nothing real to lose today. This changes the moment B8 gives those
  branches real work (candidate matching, pricing validation): a rejected
  compliance gate would then strand genuine, already-completed talent/
  commercial output that had nothing to do with the compliance reviewer's
  actual objection.
- **Status:** accepted-for-now — matches the only existing precedent in
  this codebase (`requirement_gate_node`'s reject behavior), not a new
  pattern invented for B7. Scheduled to be revisited deliberately at B8,
  when talent/commercial branches first have real output worth preserving
  through a downstream gate's rejection — not something to silently carry
  forward past that point.
- **Test:** `tests/integration/test_orchestration_nodes.py::
  test_compliance_gate_node_rejection_routes_to_rejected` covers the
  current (accepted) behavior itself; `test_graph_execution.py::
  test_full_smoke_path_start_to_complete` exercises the full corrected
  topology end to end (all three gates, in order, reaching `completed`).
  No test exists yet for the stranded-output scenario, since it isn't
  reachable until B8 gives the sibling branches something real to
  produce.

## [B7] Gemini free-tier quota varies enormously by model — verify per-day, not just per-minute, before a live run

- **Discovered:** B7's live Docker smoke test. `gemini-3-pro-preview` is
  retired (404). `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` exists but returned 429 with
  `limit: 0` on this account's free tier — the "pro" tier isn't reachable
  at all, at any per-minute rate. `gemini-3.5-flash` (non-lite, one tier
  below pro) looked viable from a single verification call, but under a
  real 74-requirement compliance pass it hit `GenerateRequestsPerDay
  PerProjectPerModel-FreeTier, limit: 20` — a **daily**, not per-minute,
  cap. Every subsequent call retried with the provider's own ~30s
  `retryDelay` before failing, so the worker sat retrying calls that could
  not possibly succeed again until the daily quota reset, for potentially
  an hour or more, across two separate interrupted runs' worth of queued
  jobs.
- **Behaviour:** a single successful verification call (Part P discipline)
  is not sufficient evidence that a model is viable for a real multi-call
  run — it doesn't distinguish a per-minute limit (survivable: the call
  just gets slower) from a per-day limit (fatal: no number of retries
  within the session will ever succeed once exhausted). The two failure
  modes look identical from one test call and only differ once you either
  read the quota metric name in a 429's error body (`...PerMinute...` vs
  `...PerDay...`) or exhaust the quota for real.
  `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (same tier already proven reliable across B5/B6's
  own extensive live use as `VERIFIER_MODEL`) turned out to be the
  correct choice — a per-minute-only limit (15 RPM), not a low daily wall.
- **Risk:** low ongoing, now that the correct model is set — but the
  failure mode (a worker silently burning real wall-clock time on
  unrecoverable-today retries) will recur for any future block that picks
  a new model without checking this specifically. `REASONING_MODEL` is now
  `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` in `.env`, live-verified against a full
  74-requirement run end to end via the real Docker smoke test.
- **Status:** resolved for `REASONING_MODEL` specifically. The general
  risk (a future block choosing a new model alias without checking whether
  its free-tier limit is per-minute or per-day) is recorded here as a
  standing process note, not something one model choice closes out.
- **Test:** none automated (this is an operational/cost concern, not a
  code-correctness one) — the live Docker smoke test itself is the
  evidence: full RFP (74 requirements) processed end to end with
  `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` as `REASONING_MODEL`, no quota exhaustion.
